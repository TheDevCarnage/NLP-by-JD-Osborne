    "\n",
    "### Disadvantage of using regex\n",
    "\n",
    "They can get very complicated, especially for lots of date and location formats. This makes them hard to maintain and update over time. Even small mistakes can lead to privacy issues.\n",
    "It's tricky to get regular expressions to match just the right stuff. They might replace things they shouldn't (overmatching) or miss stuff they should catch (undermatching). You need lots of testing to get them working right.\n",

    "**Give 2 limitations of ChatGPT to explain why it is likely to have difficulty with identifying this person**\n",

    "### Advantage of BPE Tokenizer\n",
    "- BPE operates at the subword level, breaking down words into smaller units called subword tokens. This allows BPE to handle languages with complex morphology and create subword tokens for inflected forms, reducing vocabulary size and increasing coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BPE is data-driven and adaptive. It dynamically adjusts the subword vocabulary based on the training data, which means it can handle domain-specific or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words effectively. Traditional tokenization approaches often struggle with OOV words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BPE is language-agnostic and can be applied to various languages without the need for language-specific tokenization rules or dictionaries. This makes it suitable for multilingual and cross-lingual applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BPE helps in vocabulary compression by representing frequent subword patterns with shorter codes and less frequent patterns with longer codes. This compression can significantly reduce the memory and storage requirements for NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BPE can break down rare or complex words into subword tokens, making it easier for models to generalize to out-of-distribution words. Traditional tokenization may tokenize rare words into suboptimal fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BPE provides consistent tokenization for similar words, reducing the sparsity of word embeddings. For example, it can tokenize \"running\" and \"runner\" in a consistent way by using subword units.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BPE retains some character-level information, which can be useful for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or handling misspellings. Traditional tokenization typically discards character-level details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BPE is often used as a preprocessing step for neural models like Transformers. It can be integrated seamlessly into model pipelines, ensuring compatibility with state-of-the-art NLP architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BPE can handle words with various morphological variations by breaking them down into subword components. This is particularly useful for languages with rich morphology.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BPE allows models to learn better token-level representations because it exposes models to a richer set of subword units. This can enhance the ability to capture meaning in context."

    "When I'm comparing two token probability distributions using KL Divergence, I have to remember that it's not a symmetric measurement. That means if I calculate the KL Divergence from distribution A to distribution B, I'll get a different number than if I calculate it from distribution B to A.\n",

    "So whenever I use KL Divergence, I need to consciously choose the direction I want to compare and be clear about what exactly that comparison means for my analysis. I can't just switch the distributions around and assume the number means the same thing - because with KL Divergence, it definitely doesn't! Keeping the meaning of the direction in mind will help me avoid potential mistakes when interpreting the results."

    "### Difference in the perplexities of GPT-2, BioGPT and Bert-base-uncased\n",
    "\n",
    "- GPT-2 is considered a general-purpose language model developed by OpenAI in 2019. It was trained on a broad dataset of over 40 GB of internet text and web pages, allowing it to understand and generate very human-like text on a wide range of topics. A key aspect of GPT-2 is that it is an auto-regressive language model, meaning it predicts the next word in a sequence by looking at the previous words and contexts. This enables GPT-2 to attain state-of-the-art performance on many natural language processing tasks like text generation, summarization, and machine translation. The fact that GPT-2 was trained on such a large and diverse corpus makes it adaptable to many domains, though it may lack deeper knowledge of specialized fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast, BioGPT is a biomedical domain-specific language model created by training the GPT-2 architecture on scientific texts from biology, medicine, biochemistry, and more. By specializing the model on scientific publications and medical datasets, BioGPT gains more in-depth knowledge of technical terminology, jargon, names of medications/diseases, and other niche concepts frequently discussed in the biomedical literature. This allows BioGPT to generate more coherent and accurate text when dealing with healthcare-related applications. However, its adaptability to general domains would likely be less effective compared to GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, BERT represents an architectural shift from standard auto-regressive models like GPT-2. BERT uses a bidirectional training approach, allowing it to incorporate context from both directions when encoding text. This grants BERT greater semantic understanding and ability to model relationships. Pre-trained BERT models have obtained state-of-the-art results on tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, and natural language inference across many datasets. The uncased versions disregard capitalization, ideal for tasks where case doesn't matter. Overall, BERT excels at language understanding whereas GPT-2 specializes in language generation."
